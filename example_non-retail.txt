Tulf: Ah, it's you, the 'taller dwarf'. The stories have already reached Kazordoon. I usually don't trust rumors, but if you bring me the head of the Horned Fox - I may begin to and pay you well.

Shy Teddy: mission
Tulf: You were supposed to bring the head of the Horned Fox. What are you doing here again?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: scroll
Tulf: That's one cunning fox! He must have sensed something to run away from his hideout. Our deal was about his head, so I can't reward you, sorry, hehe! But I admire the fact you were brave enough to go there and steal from his bedside drawer ...

Tulf: I did not expect that at all! The story of your heroic deed has already spread all over Kazordoon. Some dwarfs think you might even be as strong as we are!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: mission
Tulf: I don't have anything to do for you. Unless you want to visit the Horned Fox bedroom in search for his head again. Do it anytime, you have my blessing, jawoll!

Jimbin: Some miners like to tell the story of the three prisoners who allegedly managed to escape and were never found again ...
Jimbin: Don't buy these stories. Even if they'd tried, they would have surely burned in the pool of lava. There is no way to escape such a marvel!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: dwacatra
Budrik: That old Jimbin is still acting like the escape from Dwacatra is a fairy tale? You want to know the truth, then ask Hergom!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: hergom
Budrik: Hergom works in a nearby mine, he'll tell you the real story.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: hergom
Budrik: I recognize that helmet! It surely belonged to Hergom! What happened?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: dead
Budrik: Ohh, poor old Hergom, at least he died a glorious death - inside a mine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: dwacatra
Budrik: Ehh... Since poor Hergom is no more, I'll tell you what I heard from him. Three dwarves had escaped from Dwacatra - Okhar, Burnad, and Firumir. Hergom said he hadn't heard anything of the other two, but one he knew personally ...

Budrik: He supposedly fled from Kazordoon and never came back lest he be caught. Hergom didn't mention which one of the three that was or where he'd been hiding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: firumir
Nelliem: So you know about my father... Most of all, he wasn't guilty! He was wrongly convicted, I swear he never conspired with any cyclopses. Some other dwarf falsely reported him because they competed for beautiful Baribrebo ...

Nelliem: So you know about my father... Most of all, he wasn't guilty! He was wrongly convicted, I swear he never conspired with any cyclopses. Some other dwarf falsely reported him because they competed for beautiful Baribrebo ...
Nelliem: And my father, being the finest carpenter in Kazordoon, was to win! If it hadn't been for these bastards who put him in the prison. But he outsmarted them and escaped. With the help of two other dwarves, he dug a tunnel ...

Nelliem: He then fled to Venore on a steamboat and lived on, havin taken on the name of a long forgotten miner.

Nelliem: You're wondering how they were even able to dig a tunnel that was never found? Haha! You won't believe it, the part of the tunnel was flooded, and they had to dive to get further ...

Nelliem: My father remembered that till his last days. He kept saying they had to be very careful, diving in the dark, forced to push forward until they could reach the dry part. It had all been calculated, because one wrong turn would make you drown ...
Nelliem: But that's nothing yet. Digging further in the dry tunnel, they found themselves very close to the basilisk! He said they'd been able to hear the beast hiss ominously right behind the wall! Luckily enough, for some reason, it couldn't hear them ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nelliem: But that's nothing yet. Digging further in the dry tunnel, they found themselves very close to the basilisk! He said they'd been able to hear the beast hiss ominously right behind the wall! Luckily enough, for some reason, it couldn't hear them ...
Nelliem: Even though rumors have it that the basilisk is a very cunning monster. Either way, you may consider that a miracle, but they made it! I give it all to my father, the smartest of all dwarves.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: basilisk
Nelliem: If my father had hit the wrong spot, he would have crashed the wall between them, and he would've been a stone pillar now! And I would never have been born.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: tunnel
Nelliem: The tunnel that my father dug might still be there undiscovered. But who knows, it's been so long. I hope I will never have to find out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: firumir
Nelliem: Now you know everything. I hope you're not the gossiping type.

Melchior: The djinns have an ancient code of honour. This code includes a special concept of hospitality. Anybody who utters the word of greeting must not be attacked even if he is an enemy. Well, at least that is what the code says. ...
Melchior: I have found out, though, that this does not work at all times. There is no point to say the word of greeting to an enraged djinn. ...

Melchior: And keep in mind that you must choose sides in this conflict. You can only follow the Efreet or the Marid - once you have made your choice there is no way back. I know from experience that djinn do not tolerate double-crossing.

Umar: Whoa? You know the word! Amazing, Shy Teddy! ...

Umar: I should go and tell Fa'hradin. ...
Umar: Well. Why are you here anyway, Shy Teddy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Umar: If you want to enter our fortress you have to become one of us and fight the Efreet. ...
Umar: So, are you willing to do so?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Umar: Oh. Ok. Welcome then. You may pass. ...
Umar: And don't forget to kill some Efreets, now and then.

Bo'ques: My collection of recipes is almost complete. There are only but a few that are missing. ...
Bo'ques: Hmmm... now that we talk about it. There is something you could help me with. Are you interested?

Fa'hradin: Excavations?! As we suspected. So it is true. Tell me, did they discover anything?

Shy Teddy: aqueducts
Fa'hradin: An underground aqueduct?! That is very strange and disconcerting. Have you found out what they're after?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: transportation
Fa'hradin: I'm sorry, I must have misheard that... They're looking for what?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: Should we manage to drain it, we might be able to use this system to finally find a way inside the mysterious structures
Fa'hradin: Drat! If they really are close to finding the entrance to the antique edifices, then it is indeed worse that I thought ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fa'hradin: Drat! If they really are close to finding the entrance to the antique edifices, then it is indeed worse that I thought ...

Fa'hradin: Well, let's see. ...
Fa'hradin: I think I need to talk to Gabel about this. I am sure he will know what to do. Perhaps you should have a word with him, too.

Djema: If you ever find yourself in Ab'Dendriel, please bring me back some of the local earth in this vial, would you? And don't you lose it! I paid dearly for it! That merchant said it had magical properties that maintain the quality of the earth.

Shy Teddy: mission
Haroun: Well, I had a chance to study books on magic metals the other day. And I'm very intrigued by one in particular - ancient magic metal called Za'Kalortith. I would very much like to know more about that metal and where it can be procured.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy Teddy: yes
Djema: Delightful! That is exaclty what I needed! I cannot wait to make a poultice out of it and apply it to my poor skin! I used to pay the merchant 600 gold pieces, and I should think you'll be satisfied with the same amount. I surely intend not to overpay!
